# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot-Car
This project proposes robotic vehicle directs itself whenever an obstacle comes in its path so as to protect the robot from any physical damages.
This is achieved with the help of ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection and a micro-controller (ARDUINO).
The sensor sends a command to the micro-controller. Depending on the input signal received, the micro-controller redirects the robot to move in an alternate direction by actuating the motors which are interfaced to it through a motor driver.
